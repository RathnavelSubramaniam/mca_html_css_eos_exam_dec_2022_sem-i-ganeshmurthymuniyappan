              <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Nam, minima rerum <br>
                   id recusandae ipsa molestias praesentium dolorem repellat? Dicta minima odio doloremque neque The peacock is the most beautiful bird in the world. It is a tall but slender bird with a long feather tail. The bird has different shades of blue and green feathers. Peacock is a male species that has a beautiful crest of feathers on its head. There are two types of Peacocks found on this earth. One is The Indian Peacock, and the other is the Burmese Peacock. The difference between both types of peacocks is their type of crest. While the Indian Peacock has a tuft of hair on its crest, the Burmese Peacock has a Pointed Crest.
                   
                   
                   Apart from the distinctive crest, Peacock has beautiful and colourful feathers on its back. The long and bright tail of the peacock is known as a train. Violet in colour, the feathers of the Peacock are very long and beautiful. The moon-like spots on Peacock's feathers make the shape of an eye when fully opened. In contrast to the upper feathers that are bright violet in colour and big, the back wings are dull brown and short in size.
                   
                   
                   Blue in colour, Peacock, has a beautiful neck, and when he dances, his neck looks graceful and bright. While Peacock is a male bird, Peahen is a female bird and lacks some beautiful features, unlike Peacock. Peahen doesn't have a distinctive crest on her head and is generally smaller in size than Peacock. Also, Peahen doesn't have beautiful feathers like Peacock and has dull looks.
